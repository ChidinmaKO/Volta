#### Why Volta?
This repo was named after [Lake Volta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Volta) which is located in [Ghana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana) ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­ and covers &asymp; 3.6% of Ghana's land space. It is the largest man-made lake in the world by surface area and 4th largest by volume! The [Black Volta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Volta) and [White Volta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Volta) are the major inflows to the Lake Volta while the [Volta River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volta_River) is the major outflow for Lake Volta.

Lake Volta is seated behind the [Akosombo Dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akosombo_Dam), which provides electricity for the country of Ghana and also for export to neighboring countries.
